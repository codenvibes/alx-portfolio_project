## What’s this “Research & project approval”?
Before starting any coding, you will need to research and define your portfolio project over the course of 3 weeks. In the first week, the Project Proposal will be approved, followed by the second week where the MVP will be defined, and finally presented as a collection of tasks on a Trello board.

This first part is focused on creating a Project Proposal and requires that a google Document is submitted for Manual Review by a technical staff member. Please take time to brainstorm, research, and explore what currently exists during this first phase.
