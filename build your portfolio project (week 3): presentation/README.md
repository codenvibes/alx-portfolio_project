## The Presentation
You’ve done so much! You’ve come so far. The day to present your portfolio project is nearly here.

The presentation will consist of several parts:

- A slidedeck made with Google Slides
- Introduction of team members, and each person’s role
- Story of how your project was inspired
- Technology & Architecture
- Core algorithms and code snippet
- Discussion of process, collaboration and timeline
- Challenge(s) overcome
- Live Demo
- Learnings about technical interests as a result of this project
- Time to answer questions from the audience
- Feedback and comments provided by technical staff, possibly alum guests

The length of time for a presentation will be 18 minutes

You will have 2 minutes setup, 8 minutes to present followed by 8 min Q&A.

Presentations take practice. The mid-week PLD will give you that opportunity! Come prepared to practice.

### Great Presentations
It might be helpful to take a look at this [playlist of Ted talks about giving great presentations](https://www.ted.com/playlists/574/how_to_make_a_great_presentation).

Here are some great speakers to observe and pattern your speaking after:

- Steve Jobs at Stanford Commencement 2005
- Sheryl Sandberg: Take the Lead Challenge
- Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture: Achieving your childhood dreams
What do these speakers have in common? Why are their presentations effective?
