<h2>Last run!</h2>

<p>Yes! the portfolio project of the Webstack specialization will be your last-major-project!</p>


<br>
<h2>Make your choice</h2>

<p>You will have almost 2 weeks to develop your portfolio project - during this period you will be alone or by team - to create a fully functional web application.</p>

<p>Be before starting any coding, you will need to research and define the project.</p>

<p>This project is important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Because it will end your pathway at ALX </li>
<li>It’s summarize the entire Back-end specialization</li>
<li>The weight of this project is important in your overall score</li>
<li>You can be as creative as you want</li>
<li>And the most important: <strong>You should be proud of it</strong> - it will be THE project to show off during interview</li>
</ul>


<br>
<h2>Solo or by team?</h2>

<p>Good question right? </p>

<p>The first question you should ask yourself is: <strong>what I want to do?</strong></p>

<p>Front-end app? Mobile app? Back-end app? API service? e-commerce website? cloud platform for videos streaming? or better: a learning platform? </p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to work in a team - “more resources” means bigger project - but also more soft-skills.</p>

<p>Working solo is also fine - just don’t think too big or find quick-win to achieve your project.</p>


<br>
<h2>No idea?</h2>

<p>Be creative doesn’t mean “create a web application that will make the world a better place” - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming…)</p>

<p>Try to solve a problem or learn!</p>

<p>Also, a web application doesn’t only mean “Website”, it can also be just an API.</p>


<br>
<h2>Steps of this portfolio project</h2>

<p>To end the curriculum, the portfolio project is split in 3 parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pitch (this project)</li>
<li>The development</li>
</ul>

<p>Ready? Go!</p>
