<h2>GO!</h2>

<p>Yes it’s time to white-board, to code, to troubleshoot bugs, to re-code, to solve other bugs, to refactor, etc..</p>

<p>Development is not a long quiet river, but it can be really fun!</p>

<p>Starting today, you are building <strong>YOUR</strong> project - be proud of it!</p>

<br>
<h2>Evaluation - Show off!</h2>

<p>After the pitch, now you will code - nice right? but don’t forget you will present it at the end (the Peer Learning Day following this project) in front of professionals and staff.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

## Tasks
<details>
<summary>

### 0. The presentation
`mandatory`

</summary>

<p>You will present your project individually or as a team on a zoom call.</p>

<p>Your presentation, inclusive of the demo, should not exceed 16 minutes. You are expected to provide the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A public GitHub repository for your project.</li>
<li>  A Google Slides presentation including:

<ul>
<li>  A brief description of the project and your team. </li>
<li>  A breakdown of the architecture and the technologies or third-party services used.</li>
<li>  A report of your developments, highlighting your successes, challenges, areas for improvement, lessons learned, and next steps for your project.</li>
<li>  A conclusion summarizing your experience.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember, the presentation is a vital part of your project completion, so be sure to include it in your planning to avoid any delays in submission.</strong></p>

### 1. Video Demo of your project
`mandatory`

</summary>

<p>Alongside your project presentation, we require a short video demo, no longer than 3 minutes, that showcases the essential features of your project, illustrating how they all work together. This could take the form of a user walkthrough.</p>

<p>We’ve created a tutorial video to inspire you with our expectations. Think of it as an inspirational tool, <strong>not a strict template</strong>, designed to help you effectively showcase your brilliant work. Your creativity and individual touch will make your demo even more engaging.</p>

<br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/PWsDWYTOW2U"><img src="https://github.com/codenvibes/alx-portfolio_project/blob/master/portfolio_project_Short_Specializations/webstack%20-%20portfolio%20project/images/task_1.png"></a>
<br>

<p>A few points to consider while preparing your video:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Maximum Video Duration</strong>: The video should not exceed <strong>3 minutes</strong>, ensuring it is concise and engaging.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Background Music</strong>: If you include background music, ensure it’s <strong>copyright-free</strong> to avoid potential legal issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voice-Overs</strong>: Feel free to use your voice to guide us through your project. Ensure your voice is clear, audible, and not overshadowed by the background music.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recommended Tools</strong>:  We suggest using</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recording</strong>: Zoom(record + screenshare), Loom, Camtasia, etc</li>
<li><strong>Editing tools</strong> such as:  Filmora Wondershare, Camtasia for your video creation.</li>
<li><strong>How to share</strong>: YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, use a similar site), or a cloud storage service (G-drive, One-drive, etc). Submit the URL of your video. <strong>Make sure your video is accessible to the public</strong> - On YouTube, it’s fine to flag it as <strong>“unlisted,”</strong> but don’t flag it as <strong>“private”</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note that your project will not be considered complete without this video submission. It forms an integral part of your final project assessment.</strong></p>

<p>So, let’s see your creativity in action.</p>

<p>We are eagerly awaiting your presentations and demo videos.</p>

<p>Happy building,</p>
