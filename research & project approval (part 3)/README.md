## What’s a Portfolio Project?
The Portfolio Project will be a project you will showcase on your resumé, online, and during interviews. A completed Portfolio Project will consist of:
- A landing page describing your project
- A comprehensive `README.md`
- A demo of the project
- A presentation
- A blog post


<br>

## Why build a Portfolio project?
The Portfolio Project serves several different purposes:
1. Highlights a Student’s unique interests and background when networking, or interviewing with potential employers.
2. Provides a realistic workplace scenario where engineers create a solution to fit loosely defined requirements, break this down into concrete tasks and implement on a deadline.
3. Allows for self-directed learning to explore a new technical topic, deepen understanding of a curriculum-covered topic, or use technology to bring an idea to life.


<br>

## Timeline and checkpoints
Projects can be developed alone, or in teams of up to 3 students. The technologies and project concept are defined by the student teams.

<br>

## What’s the Trello board?
[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a free project management software that uses a [kanban board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) to visually track the implementation of a feature set from “to-do” to “done”. Trello makes it easy to assign tasks, collaborate and collect notes in a central location.

There are other project management tools, such as [Asana](https://asana.com/ko), [Airtable](com), and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). Trello has been selected for ease of use and ability to visualize progress.

## Some things to think about
### Scope of tasks
Creating well-scoped tasks is a skill that requires practice. Also explore creating subtasks within a task.

### Dependencies
Some tasks will rely on other ones to first be completed. Other tasks can be done in parallel but may require integration with other components along the way. Define your tasks with dependencies in mind.

### Priority
Similar to thinking about dependencies, it will also be important to complete the highest-risk part of your software first to ensure that the central workflows of your software can be completed. It may make sense to prioritize tasks that the team is least knowledgeable about, or require the greatest resources.
