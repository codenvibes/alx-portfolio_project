## And now, we build!
This week is all about execution! You have a detailed plan and you’ve thought through many aspects of your project. Now, get to work and try to hit the goals you’ve set for yourself or your team. The deliverable for the upcoming week will be a status report to share the challenges and progress you’ve encountered this week.

## PLD: Portfolio Project Checkin
During the PLD this week, these are the objectives:

- Each team meets with 3 other teams, one at a time for 40 minutes.
- During the team-team meeting, each team presents for 20 minutes, then observes for 20 minutes.
- When a team is presenting, they share their proposal, problem statement, and walk through code any they’ve implemented and technical choices they have made.
- When a team is observing, they ask questions, share observations, and code review.
