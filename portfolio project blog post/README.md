You’ve done it! You’re on the other side of your final project. There’s just a few finishing touches before we complete the year.

For this project, write a blog post about your portfolio project to capture all the trials and learnings you’ve encountered along the way. Everything you struggled with, and everything you’ve accomplished needs to be written down now before you forget! Capturing these details make a world of difference when it comes time to present your project to employers. Especially if you choose to continue with a Specialization for Year 2, it will be imperative that you can easily recall the details of this project and explain them expertly.

If you’ve done the work planning and researching along the way, you’ll have a lot more material to draw from. Feel free to refer back to the plans you created for yourself, and reflect upon whether those may be interesting to share. Also feel free to include images, screenshots, or text from the proposals.

Please include your LinkedIn link and the source post.

### 1. Introduction
`mandatory`

</summary>

Introduce your project with a few key elements:

Include a banner image on your post that is a screenshot (or a logo) of your application
Define the purpose of your project
Share your team members, roles and timeline
Describe who your project was created for
Explain what your personal focus was
Example: Our project helps bicyclists find a route with the least elevation between two points in San Francisco. Our team members are John Smith, Jane Doe, and myself. As an engineering problem, we wanted to focus on 2 things: creating an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly, and also sourcing a reliable and sophisticated API. John worked on [XYZ], Jane and I worked on [ABC].

### 2. Tell a story about yourself which relates to why you chose to work on this project
`mandatory`

</summary>

This is not simply a sentence to describe an affinity for something and therefore, you made this project. This story needs to share something personal about yourself that people can’t easily know about you by looking at your Twitter.

Here’s an example of a story that is too simple:

Everyone on our team really likes riding bicycles, so we thought it would be cool to do a project focused on bicycling.

This is a better example of a story:

Everyone on our team enjoys riding bicycles, so it was an easy project focus to agree upon. For me, bicycling has always been the best way to get around. In past jobs I’ve had, I’ve been able to commute by bicycle so that I could get my workout in before and after work.

This is an example of a story that will really captivate your audience:

Everyone on our team enjoys riding bicycles, so it was an easy project focus to agree upon. For me, I grew up in a small middle-of-America town surrounded by farms and forests. My best friend lived in the next town over, and the only way I could visit her was by riding my bicycle. On weekends, and holiday breaks I would get up at the break of dawn and bike for over an hour to my friend’s place. The road I took was lined by corn fields on both sides with the sun rising on the left. Whenever I bike in the city now, it brings back these hours I spent chasing the brightening horizon at dawn with the smell of the harvest around me. I hope to make bicycling more accessible so that more people, especially city people, can learn the joy that bicycling can bring to their lives.

A question I often hear is: “But I don’t have a story. I just thought [X] was cool so I thought I would do a project about it. What do I write?”

Here’s a couples examples of what you might write if this was the case:

Oddly enough, I don’t really have any interest in bicyling, even though my project is all about bicycle routes. I had decided very early on that I wanted to work with the Google Maps API, and needed a reason to use it. A few weeks ago I had lunch with an engineering friend of mine to brainstorm project ideas and he described a problem he faces every day: He enjoys riding his bicycle to work, but still hasn’t quite found the optimal path from home to work, and work to home with the least uphill. I learned this about myself– it’s a lot more interesting to work on something when I’m directly helping someone solve a problem they have. For the entirety of this project, I’ve been working closely with him to iterate and find him an easy path to and from his home!

It’s okay if the story just isn’t there. Find another way to share something about yourself.

My team really cared about bicycling, so I went along with it because I thought it was an interesting technical challenge. To celebrate completing our project, we rented bicycles and went for a ride around the city. I moved to this city from a small middle-of-America town surrounded by farms and forests 9 months ago. I had been out of work for 2 years ever since they shut down the button factory and laid off 350 workers. My entire career had been spent as the mechanic monitoring the hydrolic systems at this factory for the past 5 years. I have two daughters and a wife who supported me in this transition across the country to take a bet on my potential to retrain as a Software Engineer. I never would have guessed that 9 months later I would be riding a bike across the Golden Gate Bridge with 2 amazing engineers I’ve met through my time at Holberton School.

### 3. Summarize what you've accomplished with your project
`mandatory`

</summary>

Describe the result of your project.

- Include a diagram of the architecture that clearly shows the flow of data through your application. If the one you created for the proposal is still accurate, use it. Otherwise create a new one that reflects the actual flow of data.
- Summarize the technologies you used and why you (or your team) made those choices. Do not list the technologies without context. For example, do not write “We used HTML, JS, Python, Django”. Instead, include the context like “For the Frontend we chose to use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. We opted not to use other frameworks because we wanted to dedicate our time to solidifying our understanding of JavaScript.”
- Provide an overview of 1-3 features you’ve completed. Here’s some examples of what is and isn’t a feature:
Feature: OAuth via Facebook. It is functionality that has value for the user.
Not a feature: The entire application is styled with Bootstrap. There is no functionality mentioned here.
Feature: The website is responsive and compatible with mobile. This means users can access the project from a mobile view!
Not a feature: The project does not have a backend. This does not have value for the end-user.
