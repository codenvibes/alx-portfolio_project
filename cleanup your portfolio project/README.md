## Let’s Clean Up
Of all the things that a potential employer looks at, code is the most important. It is after all, what they are hiring you to do. Also remember, Recruiters and Hiring Managers are busy people. Here is a real-world scenario that may help you understand how important your GitHub is to eventual job placement.


<br>

## Top of the Resumé Pile at DreamCo
Imagine this… You’re at a meetup and a friendly recruiter from DreamCo strikes up a conversation with you. He says there’s a software engineering position opening up in a few weeks and it would be great to keep in touch. You let him know you’ll follow up and send him a resume. That night you do a ton of research about DreamCo and tailor your resumé and email followup for the position. You get your resumé reviewed, iterate, and by the end of next day you confidently send him your latest draft. The Recruiter replies immediately – you’re a strong fit for the role.

Your resume is going to the top of the pile he will pass to the Hiring Manager. The Hiring Manager (your potential manager) receives a stack of 20 resumes (filtered down from the 2000 received), and she thinks you are a great candidate. She would love to speak with you. Right before she emails the recruiter to reach out to you, she finds your GitHub profile.

She randomly selects some projects and pokes around. She sees a checkin comment, “one more fix before bed” and thinks it’s not particularly professional, but at least it demonstrates diligence. She opens a random file and there are hardcoded strings being passed between functions to manage state. “That’s pretty poor coding hygiene, but style and standards can be taught. Maybe this is a one-off, ” the Manager thinks. Finally she finds a file where there is some more complex logic. Variables are poorly named, some functionality could have clearly been refactored, and one function named “addThemAllUp” spans 2 screens with 5 while loops and no comments to explain! She then flips to the next resumé on the stack.

## More Info
Manual QA Review
It is your responsibility to request a review for your code from a peer before the project’s deadline. If no peers have been reviewed, you should request a review from a TA or staff member.
